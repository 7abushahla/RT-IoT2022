## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This work presents a **deployable, lightweight machine learning (ML) framework for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** designed to operate across **edge, fog, and cloud layers** of the IoT stack. Our key contributions are summarized as follows:

* We benchmark **six lightweight ML and DL models** (SVM, RF, XGBoost, LightGBM, FCNN, Autoencoder) on the **RT-IoT2022 dataset**.
* We conduct **automated hyperparameter tuning** using Optuna for each model, ensuring optimized performance while maintaining generalizability across deployment settings.
* We apply **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)** to compress deep models (FCNN and Autoencoder) into efficient **INT8 variants**, reducing model size and latency without compromising detection accuracy.
* We **evaluate real-time deployment** across heterogeneous hardwareâ€”including **Sony Spresense** (edge), **Jetson Nano** (fog), and **Jetson AGX Orin** (cloud)â€”providing concrete latency, power, and memory usage benchmarks.
* We offer **practical insights on system design**, including window size and sampling rate considerations, to support real-time detection with minimal overhead.
* We release an **open-source, reproducible pipeline** that automates preprocessing, model tuning, quantization, and deployment testing, establishing a comprehensive baseline for future IDS development on IoT platforms.
